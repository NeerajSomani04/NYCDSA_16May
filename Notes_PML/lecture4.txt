1. Limitation of Linear Regression --> How to create a good model for classification problem.

Logistic Regression and Gradient Decent -->

Logistic regression, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression.
Idea: if we transform the linear function 𝛽0+𝛽1X using the sigmoid function S(t), then no matter what values 𝛽0, 𝛽1 or X take, y will always have values between 0 and 1.

So different 𝛽0 and 𝛽1 will give different estimations Pr.

The estimated probability is not explicitly determined by the data, but is estimated indirectly by maximum likelihood

The odds of probability -->  The odds refers to class 1 to class 0 probability ratio p:(1-p) = p/(1-p), which dictates the imbalance of the class 1 vs class 0 frequencies.

logistic regression can be viewed as a linear regression on the log odds

While p varying in (0,1) interval, the log odds ranges in (0, infinity)

Log Odds and the sigmoid function are inverse to each other
