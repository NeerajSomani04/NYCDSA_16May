Discriminant Analysis and Naive Bayes  -->

1. Conditional Probability --> P(X |Y) --> means probablity of X when Y has occured before X. Hence, X is dependent on Y.

recall, example of box A and box B with few points in Red, and black color.

joint probability --> P(X, Y) = P(Y, X) --> probability of events in X and events in Y are independent of each other.

Bayes Theoram --> explains the process and effect of swaping events (Y) and result (X) in conditional propability.
      means how P(X | Y) can be converted into P(Y | X)


Discriminant analysis --> is a statistical analysis technique which classifies based on hypothesizing the per class conditional probability distribution to be normal and pinning down these parameters by data fitting.

Probability distribution is mostly used for quantitaive measures, means for regression problems. 

But for classification problems, probability measure is used.

Bayes classifier minimizes the probability of mis-classification.

For unbalanced classes, the classical Bayesian decision theory allows us to
handle the scenario when the minority class is of particular interest.
