We will do some EDA to understand the trends in real estate market

like, which city has has 5 bedroom houses under $400k and which city has more than $400K and why.

which house is under valued 
which city is under valued and why

starting scrapy with NJMLS.com
but we can scrape any number of websites

project steps -->

1) need to scrape new jersey county, city and zip_code field
2) then use these fields to create njmls URL for each of above row and scrape them to generated needed data 
3) create a seperate table for rental income in each state
4) based on this we can analyze, which property can return what amount in how many years

first we installed scrapy-splash by using below link -->

then we started project -->
scrapy startproject real_estates_scrapy

Question to Answer:
1) How many multi-family property each town
2) Average cost of house by town
3) average number of rooms per house per town
4) average property tax per town
5) comparision between houses, which town can have less price but more rooms
6) average year built for property in town
7) which county has the hightest mean prices
8) which city has the highest mean prices
9) try to calculate the pdf for price and map it using seaborn
10) the pearson correlation of these two variables.

we can try some correlation matrix as well.
7) condition of house can be answered based on year built

we can make our project something like below:
