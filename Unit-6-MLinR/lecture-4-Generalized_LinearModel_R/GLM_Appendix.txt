GLM Summary
Linear Regression requires a target variable on the real line.
A link function transforms a target variable so that it can be equated to Xb.
The inverse link function expresses the target variable in terms of b.
Logistic regression Example:
y = {cat, dog}
y = [0,1]
LogOdds(y) = Xb
y = Inverse-LogOdds(Xb)
y = Sigmoid(Xb)

LogOdds is the link function.
Sigmoid is the inverse link function.
