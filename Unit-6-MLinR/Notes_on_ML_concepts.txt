Need to understand these terms for ML by heart -->

1) Null Hypothesis
2) p-value
3) Normal distribution
4) covariance
5) Need to read and undertand mean, mode, median everyday to memorize it better
5) variance
6) standard deviation
7) How to get the slope of a line or a curve
8) True Linear Model equation -->

Y = beta_zero (true intercept) + beta_one (True_Slope) X (this is capital x for all x values) + all errors

All errors are independent of each other and mean of error is zero and variance should be same for all errors.



Question ---> what is in the linear regression that tells us the cofidance of relationship between two variables
what does this tells us about the confidance of relationship


4 assumptions of Linear Regression -->

Normality, Linearity, Constant Variance, Independent Errors
