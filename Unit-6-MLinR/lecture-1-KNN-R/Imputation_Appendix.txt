IMPUTATION AND KNN

Concepts Presented
Standardized distance metrics
	Donâ€™t accidentally let one dimension be more important than others
caret package
	Can be useful for preprocessing data
Formulas in R.  E.g. y ~ x1 + x2
Interpret classification outputs as probabilities
	This enables ensembling the models
ConfusionMatrix
	This function from caret analyses classification models

In-class Coding Questions
Recreate missingness plots
Create count of shared missingness
Manually scale and center some data
Create pairwise distances
	For each row return which min
Remember importance of distance metric

Practice Questions
What are some imputation methods?
What are costs and benefits to different approaches to imputation?
What happens to KNN as k approaches n
What distance measures can be used for categorical data?

Additional Topics
MICE
	Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations

Advanced Challenges
Recreate the missingness pattern table for up to four combinations
	mice::md.pattern()
